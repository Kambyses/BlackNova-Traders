Hello,

In some areas of the game, we have used the amazing work that others have done to make our game better.

For the index header committed on June 23, 2012 (header1.png), we used the Nasa image 581910main_PIA14293_full.jpg, which is
available at: http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/581910main_PIA14293_full.jpg

For the second (optional) index header, also committed on June 23, 2012 (header2.png), we used the 
Nasa image 227982main_print_full.jpg, which is available at http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/227982main_print_full.jpg

For the index page buttons with mouse over, via CSS, we used the "Shiny button set" created by James Kyle (https://twitter.com/thejameskyle), from
the CSSDeck tutorial at: http://cssdeck.com/item/182/shiny-semi-transparent-colored-buttons (This is licensed under 
the Creative Commons Attributions license, as noted at http://cssdeck.com/about#tos )

For the flags in images/flags, we used the Free Country Flags by Gang of the Coconuts, from 
http://www.free-country-flags.com/flag_pack.php?id=1 , which is licensed under a Creative Commons 
Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

We are extremely greatful for these resources.
