elapsed from the beginning of the game, capped at $max_turns.


Nospoon (16 December 2001)
---------------------------
Added code to drain energy from owners and corporate planets to support
fighters. Fixed bug that stopped players reverting corporate planets back
to personal planets.

-------------------------------
Sector fighters will degrade if there is no planet (owned or corproate)
to support the fighters.

SharpBlue (04 December 2001)
-------------------------------
New log services. The logs are now kept in the database instead
of in a file. Each event has a define in the global_funcs file,
with an attached text string in the language files. The log.php
file parses the log data and outputs an intelligible string.

Also played with DHTML for the log interface. Works fine in IE,
NS6 and Mozilla. DHTML is simply disabled for browsers that
don't support it, outputting a simple table instead. Added a field
to the ships table so that users can explicitely disable DHTML if
they don't like it.


SharpBlue (03 December 2001)
-------------------------------
Fixed the broken screen resolution cookie code. Fonts for the
main interface are now dynamically selected, depending on the
screen resolution. Hopefully this will make the main interface
better for those with a resolution above 800x600. X resolution
is stored in a cookie called screenres.

 - IP ban module in the admin script

Addition of a new scheduler to the game. This makes the use of
the sysupdate.php3 file obsolete, as well as genrank.php3 and

actual system update interval does not affect any longer the game
speed.

a minimum number of required bases in a sector before a player can claim
ownership

bug fixes to the traderoute code.

Merged username & password cookies into one userpass cookie. Will soon clean up the other cookies. BNT should only have one cookie overall.


nospoon (16 September 2001)
---------------------------
Added code for reporting on sector defences. Also fixed the existing code for bases on planets. Now, the tech level of the planet defences are based on the ships tech level plus a value in the config file, if a base is present.

nospoon (12 September 2001)
---------------------------

Merged in the in game messaging system by Blindcoder.
Fixed problem with planet_owner being set to null as default.

nospoon (07 September 2001)
---------------------------

ratt (11 July 01)
------------------
The ridiculous traderoute bug reared it's ugly head again...
Should _NOW_ be fixed (No really!)

Fairly 'major' change is to Ship speed ... currently, with
an engine level of 15, travel to anywhere in a normal sized
universe took 1 turn... making engine size fairly pointless.

The new calculation method now makes real space trips take
a bit longer until engine sizes start getting up in the
very high 20's and beyond.

This means that short real space distance trade ports and/or
warp linked tradeports just because WAY more valuable, as
it should be.  With the soon-to-be introduced mines, it
will make mining valuable port combo's an important tactic.

An alternate way to handle this would have been to increase
the way distance is calculated (to the 4th power instead of
the 2nd) ... still not sure which way would be better.

Any comments on this?

Changed "Trade Route" to "Realspace Trading" on the main
menu, so people don't get confused.

ratt (09 July 01)
------------------
Refixed the Traderoute bug.  Boy, was that a nasty one
to track down.  It _SHOULD_ be working now - users should
no longer be able to carrying 2x cargo capacity.

Current plan is to finish off the combat code for the portions
that are done right now.  Then to look into adding mines/fighter
clouds, which will lead back to the combat code expansion and
balancing.  I don't want to try to balance the combat code any
more than it already is until the mines are in place, they will
add quite a bit of effect to the entire combat system.  Look
for a much more complex combat system soon, however, that will
require users to actually balance out what type of position they
wish to take (Offensive/devensive/sneaky/subversive).

First move on this will be a modification to EWD's - currently
they make ship to ship combat non-existant.  Current thinking
right now is to give them a chance of firing a certain % of the
time during each phase of combat.  This will make hanging around
less attractive than logging out on a planet.  With the new
corporate planet options, it will be worth while to concentrate
your corporations ships on a single planet and defend it.

ratt (08 July 01)
------------------
Fixed a bug in corporate planets that killed the
original owner of a planet, even if the original
owner wasn't on that planet.

Comitted current planetary combat code to SF.

This patch is rather large, and includes 3 new files:

1.  CHANGES file - will help in tracking what's changed
from patch to patch by the developers.

2.  corp.php   ... this is for corporate planets.  It's
very simple right now, but will be expanded in the future
to include more options.

3.  combat.php3  - this is the revised combat code.  It is
NOT finished, but it works (and shares a lot of code) with
the old combat system.  However, the big chang is the ability
to have more than one ship on a planet, and those ships to
defend the planet in concert.

I further plan to modularize the combat code within combat.php3
to actually handle ALL combat in the game.  Once properly
modularized, it will allow the ability to leave fighter clouds
in sectors and will include provisioning for mines.

If you encounter any bugs in the new combat system, please let
me know ASAP.  Preferably how to duplicate the bug.  I think I
stamped out most of them.   I am aware that cosmetically, the
combat system can be improved, and that's on my list of things to do.

As before, if you have not created the field planet_corp in
your BN database, you need to.  Rebanging the universe will
do this for you, but I realize for some people, that is not
an option.  Just duplicate the field planet_owner into
planet_corp and you should be ok.

If you were currently using the new corporate code, all your
players should go to thier planets and toggle the corporate
switch at least once to fix a potential bug in the previous
code.  New captured planets should not exhibit any more problems.

ratt (06 July 01)
------------------
Fixed a bug in traderoute.php3 that allowed you to have
double the amount of cargo that your holds could handle.

Fixed a bug in the corporate planet scheme that allowed the
original owner unfettered access to a planet after it was
captured if it was set to corporate when it was captured.

Fixed a bug in combat.php3 that would result in
negative fighters being left after a planetary attack,
even if you only lost 1 fighters and had a ton of
fighters left.
